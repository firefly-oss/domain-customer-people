 * Command to upsert (update) the consent record identified by

 * The translation from inbound domain-level status strings (e.g. GRANTED,
 * REVOKED) to the {@code granted} boolean is the responsibility of the caller
 * (typically the experience tier). This command intentionally exposes the
 * downstream contract — a boolean flag — to keep the domain handler thin.
